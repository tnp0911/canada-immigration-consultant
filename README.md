**IRIS (Immigration Resources for International Students)** is a full-stack AI chatbot that delivers real-time immigration guidance using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. It enables users to navigate complex IRCC (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada) policies through a conversational interface backed by a dynamic, searchable knowledge base.

International students often struggle to navigate legal documents, frequent policy updates, and long support wait times. IRIS addresses this gap by offering a reliable, user-friendly solution available 24/7.

**🔍 Key Features**
- **Large Language Model Integration (LLMs):** Delivers conversational, human-like responses to help users understand complex immigration terms and scenarios.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Ensures answers are grounded in the most up-to-date IRCC policy documents stored in a custom, searchable vector database.
- **Multi-Agent System with LangGraph:** Applies agentic AI principles to autonomously manage tasks such as document retrieval, question answering, and dialogue flow—minimizing human intervention.
- **Dynamic Admin Panel:** Enables authorized staff to update policies and documentation in real time, ensuring accuracy and compliance as IRCC guidelines evolve.

**🛠️ Tech Stack**
- 🖥️ Streamlit – Frontend interface for chatbot and admin panel
- ⚡ FastAPI – High-performance backend API framework
- 🧲 Pinecone – Vector similarity search for document retrieval (RAG)
- 🍃 MongoDB – NoSQL database for storing user queries, sessions, and logs
- 🤗 Hugging Face – Pretrained LLMs for natural language understanding and response generation

**Note:** 
- ⚠️ Designed for demonstration purposes; usage may be rate-limited, and model availability and response consistency may vary depending on external inference providers
- ☁️ Hosted on a free-tier cloud service with limited CPU and RAM ➡️ If the system falls back to the local model, responses may be unavailable
- ⏳ May experience cold starts after periods of inactivity 

### Installation
